# Password Generator

This repository contains a small web-based password generator that outputs two randomly generated passwords per action. The project focuses on practicing UI layout, styling, and basic JavaScript interaction logic.

## Project Overview

This is a solo project from the Scrimba Full Stack Path. A [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/NEj9JDycMjF3XKXq7swoc9/Random-Password-Generator--New-version-?node-id=0-1&t=qcjnhnh8hwwarZhX-1) was provided as a layout reference, but the visual design was intentionally modified. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were written manually to practice translating a design into code and separating structure, style, and logic.
